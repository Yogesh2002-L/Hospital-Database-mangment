🏥 Hospital Database Management System (SQL Project)

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Hospital Database Management System using SQL to efficiently manage hospital operations such as patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing.
The system demonstrates how relational databases help store, organize, and analyze healthcare data for better decision-making.

🎯 Problem Statement
Hospitals handle large volumes of data daily, including patient records, doctor schedules, and treatment details.
Managing this data manually or without a proper database leads to:

Data inconsistency
Redundant records
Slow reporting and analysis
This project solves these challenges by building a structured relational database with optimized SQL queries.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
Language: SQL
Tools: MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin

📂 Database Schema Includes
Patients – Patient details and demographics
Doctors – Doctor specialization and availability
Appointments – Patient-doctor scheduling
Treatments – Diagnosis and procedures
Billing – Payment and charges information
